# object-detection
This repository provides the code and datasets introduced in "Realistically distributing object placements in synthetic training data improves the performance of vision-based object detection models". 

Datasets generated using the [CARLA driving simulator](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla). In generating `baseline` dataset  we allow the CARLA Traffic Manager to freely move vehicles and take a snapshot of their positions at a particular time. While `INITIALIZE` dataset utilizes a [state-of-the-art commercial model]() that jointly samples realistic vehicle placements.

We use the [PGD model](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection3d/tree/main/configs/pgd) to train two object detection models on `baseline` and `INITIALIZE` datasets. The code for data loading and training configurations are provided.
